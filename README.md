# Loading the image

## Mount from DockerHub

Download the image from [davidelanz/jupyter](https://hub.docker.com/r/davidelanz/jupyter), 
then mount the container (the image exposes JupyterLab on the ``8888`` port):
```
docker run -p CONTANER_PORT:8888 -v EXTERNAL_FOLDER:/workspace --name CONTAINER_NAME davidelanz/jupyter
```

Your workspace will be available at [localhost:CONTANER_PORT](http://localhost:CONTANER_PORT).

## Build from GitHub

The image can be directly built from the GitHub repository:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/davidelanz/jupyter-docker
$ cd jupyter-docker/
$ docker build . -t davidelanz/jupyter
```

# Using the image

## Creating and loading new Conda environment

> The image comes already with a Python3.7 environment with OpenCV support called ``opencv-py3.7``.

You can create a new enviroment as follows (you can easily do it from the JupyterLab console):
```
conda create -y --name <DESIRED_ENV_NAME> python=<DESIRED_PYTHON_VERSION>
```
Then you can load it to JupyterLab as follows:
```
conda activate <DESIRED_ENV_NAME> && \
    conda install -y ipykernel && \
    ipython kernel install --name <DESIRED_ENV_NAME> --user
```

With Jupyter installed you get the list of currently installed kernels with:
```
jupyter kernelspec list
```

If you want to uninstall an unwanted kernel:
```
jupyter kernelspec uninstall <UNWANTED_KERNEL>
```
